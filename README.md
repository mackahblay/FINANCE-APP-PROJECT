#### Project Summary
This project leverages SQL querying, Tableau visualizations, and machine learning techniques to perform an in-depth exploration and analysis of financial data. The primary goal is to uncover valuable insights, patterns, and relationships that can inform strategic decision-making for businesses.
The dataset used spans from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016, and includes information on revenue, product categories, subcategories, customer demographics (age, gender), and geographic locations.
Through SQL querying and exploratory data analysis, numerous insights were derived, such as revenue trends, product performance, customer behavior patterns, and geographic distribution of sales.
These insights were then visualized using Tableau, creating various charts and graphics to effectively communicate the findings. Visualizations included line charts, bar charts, heat maps, scatter plots, geographic maps, and more.
To further uncover patterns and relationships within the data, machine learning models were employed. A decision tree model was built to predict customer behavior and identify the most influential factors affecting revenue generation. Additionally, linear regression and logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the impact of various features on revenue and customer preferences.
The combination of exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the financial data, enabling businesses to make informed decisions regarding product offerings, pricing strategies, target customer segments, and overall revenue optimization.
This project serves as a valuable resource for data-driven decision-making in the financial industry, offering a holistic approach to data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.
